# MongoDB Microservice App 

This is a simple Node.js microservice connected to a MongoDB database. It was created for SIT323 Cloud Native Application Development at Deakin University.

## What the App Does

When deployed, the app:
- Connects to MongoDB
- Performs a test insert into the database
- Returns a JSON response

Example output:
```json
{
  "_id": "random_generated_id",
  "message": "MongoDB connected and CRUD successful..."
}
```
